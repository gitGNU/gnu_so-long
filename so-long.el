;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Many Emacs modes struggle with buffers which contain excessively long lines,
;; and may consequently cause unacceptable performance issues.
;;
;; This is commonly on account of 'minified' code (i.e. code has been compacted
;; into the smallest file size possible, which often entails removing newlines
;; should they not be strictly necessary). These kinds of files are typically
;; not intended to be edited, so not providing the usual editing mode in these
;; cases will rarely be an issue.
;;
;; When such files are detected, we invoke `over-long-line-mode'. This mode is
;; almost equivalent to `fundamental-mode', and hence has a minimal affect on
;; performance in the buffer.
;;
;; The variables `over-long-line-mode-target-modes', `over-long-line-threshold',
;; `over-long-line-max-lines', and `over-long-line-mode-inhibited' determine
;; whether this mode will be invoked for a given file.  The tests are made after
;; `set-auto-mode' has set the normal major mode.

;;; Change Log:

;; 0.2   - Initial release to EmacsWiki.
;; 0.1   - Experimental.

  "`over-long-line-mode' affects only these modes and their derivatives.

Our primary use-case is minified programming code, so `prog-mode' covers
most cases, but there are some exceptions to this.")

  "Number of columns after which the normal mode for a file will not be
used, unless it is specified as a local variable.

`over-long-line-mode' will be used instead in these circumstances.

See `over-long-line-detected-p' for details.")

(defvar over-long-line-max-lines 20
  "Number of non-blank, non-comment lines to test for excessive length.

See `over-long-line-detected-p' for details.")

  "Set non-nil to prevent `over-long-line-mode' from being triggered.

May be used globally or buffer-locally as required.")

`over-long-line-threshold', and N is `over-long-line-max-lines').

(define-derived-mode over-long-line-mode nil "Over-long lines"
  "This mode is used if line lengths exceed `over-long-line-threshold'.

Many Emacs modes struggle with buffers which contain excessively long lines,
and may consequently cause unacceptable performance issues.

This is commonly on account of 'minified' code (i.e. code has been compacted
into the smallest file size possible, which often entails removing newlines
should they not be strictly necessary). These kinds of files are typically
not intended to be edited, so not providing the usual editing mode in these
cases will rarely be an issue.

When such files are detected, we invoke this mode. This happens after
`set-auto-mode' has set the major mode, should the selected major mode be a
member (or derivative of a member) of `over-long-line-mode-target-modes'.

By default this mode is essentially equivalent to `fundamental-mode', and
exists mainly to provide information to the user as to why the expected mode
was not used.

To revert to the original mode despite any potential performance issues,
type \\[over-long-line-mode-revert].

Alternatively, the normal mode can be manually invoked, or a file-local
`over-long-line-mode-inhibited' may be set non-nil to ensure that
the normal mode is always used for the file in question."

This advice acts after `set-auto-mode' has made its decision.

We can't sensible act before this point, as some major modes must
be exempt from `over-long-line-mode' (binary file modes, for
example).  Instead only act when the selected major mode is a member
of `over-long-line-mode-target-modes', or a derivative thereof.

If buffer-local `over-long-line-mode-inhibited' is non-nil, then
